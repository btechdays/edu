In case of critical blood demand in one time, broadcasting the message should be done to all donors with the respected blood group. The system also provide calculation for the total of blood packets which already stored into the blood bank according to each of the blood type which are A+, A- ,B+ ,B- ,AB+ ,AB- ,O+ and O- will be keep updated. Finally, through this system it is hoped that can helped the blood bank hospital administration to make a fast and effective decision through managing the blood donation management activities in more systematically way.",importantLinks:[{name:"Images and Icon",link:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GDMU6GqgFuZJRtNg6AlglbqYKEuVjbzV/view?usp=sharing"},{name:"Complete Project",link:"https://youtu.be/C0N-6VZwwf0"},{name:"Partwise Playlist",link:"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdRq0mbeEBmxuaIv2bHnlhzPqix375jBp"}]},{id:15,name:"Library Management System in Java (Netbeans IDE , Mysql Database)",shortDescription:"",thumbnail:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/sLs-2N5mAow/maxresdefault.jpg",technologyUsed:["Java","Swing JFrame","Netbeans","MySQL Database"],newProject:"no",features:[],description:"Library Management system is organizing and managing the library tasks. Library is place where all kind of books are available. This is a windows based application and only a registered user can access the application. Library Management system is developed to automate the task of entering the records of new book and retrieving the details of book available in the library. This system contains list of all the books. Using this system user checks how many book are issued and how many books are available in the library. This system provides interface and login for librarian or admin. Librarian can modify database. Using the library management system, return the issued book after the due date. This is very difficult to organize manually. Maintenance of all this information manually is a very complex task. Owing to the advancement of technology, organization of an Library becomes much simple. The Library Management has been designed to computerize and automate the operations performed over the information about the students, book issues and returns and all other operations. This computerization of library helps in many instances of its maintenances. It reduces the workload of management as most of the manual work done is reduced.",importantLinks:[{name:"Images and Icon",link:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kjHnfOHmDK_EZnRkfOBhkwGVPq3j4Xjz/view?usp=sharing"},{name:"Complete Project",link:"https://youtu.be/sLs-2N5mAow"},{name:"Partwise Playlist",link:"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdRq0mbeEBmwUyZNJsmkBjQeIneme6HCz"}]},{id:16,name:"Hospital Management System in java (JFrame, Mysql Database, Netbeans IDE)",shortDescription:"",thumbnail:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7fSIE6B9rOk/maxresdefault.jpg",technologyUsed:["Java","Swing JFrame","Netbeans","MySQL Database"],newProject:"no",features:[],description:"Hospital Management System introduction to management is an application that is designed and developed for hospital admin and patients. The system helps store to maintain records in the computer system. It helps admin to store patient information in very less time and efficiently and stored data in database and they can see the details later. It will help the hospital admin to add patient, patient report into the database. With the increasing of the population of World and revolution of the new technologies, Hospital Management System plays an important role in the real world. This proposed system of the Hospital Management System is a window based application system intends to manage the records of patients and replacing the old way of storing details. Through the manual system of keeping the items records, it is quite difficult to maintain the details of the items and their details as reference because the data can be lost or redundant. The project \u2018Hospital Management System\u2019 is based on the database, object oriented. As there are many areas where we keep the records in database for which we are using MYSQL software which is one of the best and the easiest software to keep our information. This project uses JAVA as the front-end software which is an Object Oriented Programming and has connectivity with MY SQL. Hospital Management System is custom built to meet the speci\ufb01c requirement of the mid and large size hospitals across the globe. All the required modules and features have been particularly built to just \ufb01t in to your requirement.",importantLinks:[{name:"Images and Icon",link:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WMFX6evZCHozsn5p0jgK16Un53ucmR5a/view?usp=sharing"},{name:"Partwise Playlist",link:"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdRq0mbeEBmx-z7D25PbNPl18aNObTUOV"}]}]},7720:(p,l,o)=>{o.d(l,{$:()=>f});var d=o(2340),e=o(5e3),h=o(4100),m=o(9014),u=o(9808);function g(a,n){if(1&a){const t=e.EpF();e.TgZ(0,"div")(1,"span",1),e.NdJ("click",function(){const r=e.CHM(t).$implicit;return e.oxw().viewProjectDetails(null==r?null:r.id)}),e.TgZ(2,"p"),e._UZ(3,"img",2),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(4,"h2"),e._uU(5),e.qZA(),e._UZ(6,"hr"),e.qZA()()}if(2&a){const t=n.$implicit;e.xp6(3),e.s9C("src",null==t?null:t.thumbnail,e.LSH),e.xp6(2),e.Oqu(null==t?null:t.name)}}let y=(()=>{class a{constructor(t){var s;this.router=t,this.projects=m.p,this.max=null===(s=this.projects)||void 0===s?void 0:s.length,this.min=1,this.temp=[],this.projectDetails=[],this.tempLoopNumber=1}ngOnInit(){for(var t=[];t.length<3;){var s=Math.floor(Math.random()*this.max)+1;-1===t.indexOf(s)&&t.push(s)}for(var i=0;i<t.length;i++){var r=t[i];this.temp=m.p.filter(c=>c.id==r),this.projectDetails.push(this.temp[0])}console.log(this.projectDetails)}viewProjectDetails(t){this.router.navigateByUrl("/project/"+t)}}return a.\u0275fac=function(t){return new(t||a)(e.Y36(h.F0))},a.\u0275cmp=e.Xpm({type:a,selectors:[["app-popular-projects"]],decls:4,vars:1,consts:[[4,"ngFor","ngForOf"],[3,"click"],[2,"height","150px","width","100%",3,"src"]],template:function(t,s){1&t&&(e.TgZ(0,"h3")(1,"b"),e._uU(2,"Popular Projects"),e.qZA()(),e.YNc(3,g,7,2,"div",0)),2&t&&(e.xp6(3),e.Q6J("ngForOf",s.projectDetails))},directives:[u.sg],styles:[""]}),a})(),f=(()=>{class a{constructor(){this.url=d.N.route}ngOnInit(){}}return a.\u0275fac=function(t){return new(t||a)},a.\u0275cmp=e.Xpm({type:a,selectors:[["app-layout"]],decls:44,vars:0,consts:[[1,"header"],[1,"topnav"],["href",""],["href","blogs"],["href","purchase-source-code"],["href","#"],["href","#",2,"float","right"],[1,"row"],[1,"leftcolumn"],[1,"rightcolumn"],[1,"card"],["href","https://twitter.com/BtechDays","target","_blank"],["src","assets/twitter.png",2,"width","50px","height","50px","padding","5px"],["href","https://www.instagram.com/btechdays/","target","_blank"],["src","assets/instagram.png",2,"width","50px","height","50px","padding","5px"],["href","https://www.youtube.com/c/BTechDays","target","_blank"],["src","assets/youtube.png",2,"margin-left","5px","width","50px","height","50px","padding","2px"],["href","https://www.paypal.me/btechdays","target","_blank"],["src","assets/paypal.png",2,"width","150px","height","50px","padding","5px"],[1,"footer"]],template:function(t,s){1&t&&(e.TgZ(0,"html"),e._UZ(1,"head"),e.TgZ(2,"body")(3,"div",0)(4,"h1"),e._uU(5,"BTech Days"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(6,"p"),e._uU(7,"Education is key to success"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(8,"div",1)(9,"a",2),e._uU(10,"Projects"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(11,"a",3),e._uU(12,"Blogs"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(13,"a",4),e._uU(14,"Get Source Code"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(15,"a",5),e._uU(16,"About"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(17,"a",6),e._uU(18,"Contact"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(19,"div",7)(20,"div",8),e._UZ(21,"router-outlet"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(22,"div",9)(23,"div",10),e._UZ(24,"app-popular-projects"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(25,"div",10)(26,"h3"),e._uU(27,"Follow Us"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(28,"p")(29,"a",11),e._UZ(30,"img",12),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(31,"a",13),e._UZ(32,"img",14),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(33,"a",15),e._UZ(34,"img",16),e.qZA()()(),e.TgZ(35,"div",10)(36,"h3"),e._uU(37,"Donate Us"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(38,"p")(39,"a",17),e._UZ(40,"img",18),e.qZA()()()()(),e.TgZ(41,"div",19)(42,"h2"),e._uU(43,"All rights reserved @ BTech Days::2020-2022"),e.qZA()()()())},directives:[h.lC,y],styles:["",""]}),a})()}}]);
