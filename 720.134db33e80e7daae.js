It also provides the facility of the search for searching the records efficiently & immediately. This system provides data storing with a graphical user interface (GUI). Gym Management System provides a system that handles the information of the people coming into the gym and maintaining their health care. This system provides users the facility to make all the data-saving process easy. Update, Add, Delete, etc. Systems avoid mistakes & errors in maintaining the details of members. The main aim of our system is to provide a paperless working of the gym. It also aims at providing low-cost, reliable, automation of exiting system i.e. manual system. The system also provides the security of data at every level of user-system interaction. All the details of suppliers and maintenance details of the equipment are secured stored in the database as we have used mysql to store our data.

More time being used for lecturers to bring the questions papers and answer sheets and also more time is needed for students in order to write their exam.",importantLinks:[{name:"Images and Icon",link:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2srXABk5_FeVvhVOcIOKpbOKBaEAJe8/view?usp=sharing"},{name:"Complete Project",link:"https://youtu.be/jMgWl-0-JaY"},{name:"Partwise Playlist",link:"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdRq0mbeEBmw2W6mXcMkWS8EpH-3HEyyZ"}]}]},7720:(p,l,s)=>{s.d(l,{$:()=>f});var d=s(2340),e=s(5e3),h=s(4100),m=s(9014),u=s(9808);function g(a,n){if(1&a){const t=e.EpF();e.TgZ(0,"div")(1,"span",1),e.NdJ("click",function(){const r=e.CHM(t).$implicit;return e.oxw().viewProjectDetails(null==r?null:r.id)}),e.TgZ(2,"p"),e._UZ(3,"img",2),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(4,"h2"),e._uU(5),e.qZA(),e._UZ(6,"hr"),e.qZA()()}if(2&a){const t=n.$implicit;e.xp6(3),e.s9C("src",null==t?null:t.thumbnail,e.LSH),e.xp6(2),e.Oqu(null==t?null:t.name)}}let y=(()=>{class a{constructor(t){var o;this.router=t,this.projects=m.p,this.max=null===(o=this.projects)||void 0===o?void 0:o.length,this.min=1,this.temp=[],this.projectDetails=[],this.tempLoopNumber=1}ngOnInit(){for(var t=[];t.length<3;){var o=Math.floor(Math.random()*this.max)+1;-1===t.indexOf(o)&&t.push(o)}for(var i=0;i<t.length;i++){var r=t[i];this.temp=m.p.filter(c=>c.id==r),this.projectDetails.push(this.temp[0])}console.log(this.projectDetails)}viewProjectDetails(t){this.router.navigateByUrl("/project/"+t)}}return a.\u0275fac=function(t){return new(t||a)(e.Y36(h.F0))},a.\u0275cmp=e.Xpm({type:a,selectors:[["app-popular-projects"]],decls:3,vars:1,consts:[[4,"ngFor","ngForOf"],[3,"click"],[2,"height","150px","width","100%",3,"src"]],template:function(t,o){1&t&&(e.TgZ(0,"h3"),e._uU(1,"Popular Projects"),e.qZA(),e.YNc(2,g,7,2,"div",0)),2&t&&(e.xp6(2),e.Q6J("ngForOf",o.projectDetails))},directives:[u.sg],styles:[""]}),a})(),f=(()=>{class a{constructor(){this.url=d.N.route}ngOnInit(){}}return a.\u0275fac=function(t){return new(t||a)},a.\u0275cmp=e.Xpm({type:a,selectors:[["app-layout"]],decls:44,vars:0,consts:[[1,"header"],[1,"topnav"],["href",""],["href","blogs"],["href","purchase-source-code"],["href","#"],["href","#",2,"float","right"],[1,"row"],[1,"leftcolumn"],[1,"rightcolumn"],[1,"card"],["href","https://twitter.com/BtechDays","target","_blank"],["src","assets/twitter.png",2,"width","50px","height","50px","padding","5px"],["href","https://www.instagram.com/btechdays/","target","_blank"],["src","assets/instagram.png",2,"width","50px","height","50px","padding","5px"],["href","https://www.youtube.com/c/BTechDays","target","_blank"],["src","assets/youtube.png",2,"margin-left","5px","width","50px","height","50px","padding","2px"],["href","https://www.paypal.me/btechdays","target","_blank"],["src","assets/paypal.png",2,"width","150px","height","50px","padding","5px"],[1,"footer"]],template:function(t,o){1&t&&(e.TgZ(0,"html"),e._UZ(1,"head"),e.TgZ(2,"body")(3,"div",0)(4,"h1"),e._uU(5,"BTech Days"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(6,"p"),e._uU(7,"Education is key to success"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(8,"div",1)(9,"a",2),e._uU(10,"Projects"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(11,"a",3),e._uU(12,"Blogs"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(13,"a",4),e._uU(14,"Get Source Code"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(15,"a",5),e._uU(16,"About"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(17,"a",6),e._uU(18,"Contact"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(19,"div",7)(20,"div",8),e._UZ(21,"router-outlet"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(22,"div",9)(23,"div",10),e._UZ(24,"app-popular-projects"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(25,"div",10)(26,"h3"),e._uU(27,"Follow Us"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(28,"p")(29,"a",11),e._UZ(30,"img",12),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(31,"a",13),e._UZ(32,"img",14),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(33,"a",15),e._UZ(34,"img",16),e.qZA()()(),e.TgZ(35,"div",10)(36,"h3"),e._uU(37,"Donate Us"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(38,"p")(39,"a",17),e._UZ(40,"img",18),e.qZA()()()()(),e.TgZ(41,"div",19)(42,"h2"),e._uU(43,"All rights reserved - BTech Days"),e.qZA()()()())},directives:[h.lC,y],styles:["",""]}),a})()}}]);
