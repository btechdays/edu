Assuming it is, we will proceed with checking whether the tree is empty or not. If it is empty, then the new item will be inserted in the root node.However, if the tree is non-empty then we will refer to the key of the new item. When it is smaller than the root item\u2019s key, the new item will be added to the left subtree.

In contrast, the value of the constant remains unaltered during the entire program. The value of the constant is locked during the execution of the program. For example, pi's value can be set as a constant during the entire course of the program."},{id:35,name:"What is Data Structure?",content:"The data structure is a way that specifies how to organize and manipulate the data. It also defines the relationship between them. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. Data Structures are the central part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way."},{id:36,name:"Which data structure is ideal to perform recursion operation and why?",content:"Stack is the most ideal for recursion operation. This is mainly because of its LIFO (Last In First Out) property, it remembers the elements & their positions, so it exactly knows which one to return when a function is called."},{id:37,name:"What is a Stack?",content:"Stack is an ordered list in which, insertion and deletion can be performed only at one end that is called the top. It is a recursive data structure having pointer to its top element. The stack is sometimes called as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) list i.e. the element which is inserted first in the stack will be deleted last from the stack."},{id:38,name:"What is Queue?",content:"A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables insert operations to be performed at one end called REAR and delete operations to be performed at another end called FRONT."},{id:39,name:"What is a dequeue?",content:"Dequeue (also known as double-ended queue) can be defined as an ordered set of elements in which the insertion and deletion can be performed at both the ends, i.e. front and rear."},{id:40,name:"What is the minimum number of queues that can be used to implement a priority queue?",content:"Two queues are needed. One queue is used to store the data elements, and another is used for storing priorities."},{id:41,name:"What is Tree?",content:"The Tree is a recursive data structure containing the set of one or more data nodes where one node is designated as the root of the tree while the remaining nodes are called as the children of the root. The nodes other than the root node are partitioned into the nonempty sets where each one of them is to be called sub-tree."},{id:42,name:"What are Binary trees?",content:"A binary Tree is a special type of generic tree in which, each node can have at most two children. Binary tree is generally partitioned into three disjoint subsets, i.e. the root of the node, left sub-tree and Right binary sub-tree."},{id:43,name:"Define the graph data structure?",content:"A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) represents the set of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are used to connect these vertices. A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent-child relations."},{id:44,name:"Explain the difference between file structure and storage structure?",content:"File Structure: A hard disk or external device (such as USB), stores data that remains intact till manually deleted. Such a representation of data into secondary or auxiliary memory is called a file structure.<br><br>Storage Structure:  In this type of structure, data (variables, constants, etc.) are stored in the main memory, i.e. RAM, and is deleted once the function that uses this data gets completed."},{id:45,name:"What is the difference between NULL and VOID?",content:"While NULL is a value, VOID is a data type identifier. A variable assigned with a NULL value represents an empty value. The VOID is used for identifying pointers having no initial size."},{id:46,name:"How does a POP operation differ from a PUSH operation?",content:"Both PUSH and POP operations pertain to a stack. Data is added to the stack using the PUSH operation, while it is retrieved using the POP operation."},{id:47,name:"How will you insert a new item in a binary search tree?",content:"As a binary search tree doesn\u2019t allow for duplicates, the new item to be inserted must be unique. Assuming it is, we will proceed with checking whether the tree is empty or not. If it is empty, then the new item will be inserted in the root node.However, if the tree is non-empty then we will refer to the key of the new item. When it is smaller than the root item\u2019s key, the new item will be added to the left subtree. If the new item\u2019s key is bigger than the root item\u2019s key, then the new item is inserted into the right subtree."},{id:48,name:"What is hashing in data structure?",content:"The technique of converting a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array is known as hashing. It is possible to create associative data storage using hash tables where data indices can be found by providing the corresponding key values."},{id:49,name:"If you are using C language to implement the heterogeneous linked list, what pointer type will you use?",content:"The heterogeneous linked list contains different data types in its nodes and we need a link, pointer to connect them. It is not possible to use ordinary pointers for this. So we go for void pointer. Void pointer is capable of storing pointer to any type as it is a generic pointer type."},{id:50,name:"What is insertion sort?",content:"This algorithm is very popular with bridge players when they sort their cards. In this procedure, we pick up a particular value and then insert it at the appropriate place in the sorted sub list."}];var q=i(2313);let N=(()=>{class t{constructor(n,o){this.dialogData=n,this.sanitizer=o}ngOnInit(){var n;this.content=k.filter(r=>r.id==this.dialogData.data.id),this.answer=this.content[0],console.log(this.answer);const o=null===(n=this.answer)||void 0===n?void 0:n.videoLink;this.controllerSrc=this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(o),console.log(this.content)}}return t.\u0275fac=function(n){return new(n||t)(e.Y36(l.WI),e.Y36(q.H7))},t.\u0275cmp=e.Xpm({type:t,selectors:[["app-view-c-projects"]],decls:11,vars:2,consts:[["fxLayout","row"],[1,"title-center"],[1,"spacer"],["mat-icon-button","","mat-dialog-close","",1,"mat-dialog-close"],[1,"mat-typography"],["id","fadeshow1","width","640","height","360","title","YouTube video player","frameborder","0","allow","accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture","allowfullscreen","",3,"src"],["id","fadeshow2","width","100%","height","100","title","YouTube video player","frameborder","0","allow","accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture","allowfullscreen","",3,"src"]],template:function(n,o){1&n&&(e.TgZ(0,"mat-toolbar")(1,"mat-toolbar-row",0)(2,"span",1),e._uU(3,"C Projects"),e.qZA(),e._UZ(4,"span",2),e.TgZ(5,"button",3)(6,"mat-icon"),e._uU(7,"close"),e.qZA()()()(),e.TgZ(8,"mat-dialog-content",4),e._UZ(9,"iframe",5)(10,"iframe",6),e.qZA()),2&n&&(e.xp6(9),e.Q6J("src",o.controllerSrc,e.uOi),e.xp6(1),e.Q6J("src",o.controllerSrc,e.uOi))},directives:[m.Ye,m.rD,w.xw,g.lW,l.ZT,f.Hw,l.xY],styles:[".mat-toolbar[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{margin:-24px -24px 10px;width:auto;color:#fff;background:#002b5c}.title-center[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{flex:1 1 auto;text-align:center}mat-form-field[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{padding:5px}mat-card[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{font-size:18px}@media only screen and (max-width: 1026px){#fadeshow1[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{display:none}}@media only screen and (min-width: 1026px){#fadeshow2[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{display:none}}"]}),t})();function Q(t,a){if(1&t){const n=e.EpF();e.TgZ(0,"mat-card",3),e.NdJ("click",function(){const d=e.CHM(n).$implicit;return e.oxw().viewAnswer(d)}),e.TgZ(1,"mat-card-title-group")(2,"mat-card-title"),e._uU(3),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(4,"mat-card-subtitle")(5,"span"),e._UZ(6,"span",4),e.qZA()(),e._UZ(7,"img",5),e.qZA(),e._UZ(8,"br")(9,"mat-divider",6),e.TgZ(10,"mat-card-actions")(11,"button",7),e._uU(12,"View"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(13,"button",7),e._uU(14,"Share"),e.qZA()()()}if(2&t){const n=a.$implicit;e.Q6J("ngClass",a.index%2==0?"odd":"even"),e.xp6(3),e.Oqu(n.name),e.xp6(3),e.Q6J("innerHTML",n.shortDescription,e.oJD),e.xp6(1),e.s9C("src",null==n?null:n.thumbnail,e.LSH)}}let I=(()=>{class t{constructor(n){this.dialog=n,this.questions=k,this.panelOpenState=!1}ngOnInit(){}viewAnswer(n){const o=new l.vA;o.data={action:"Edit",data:n},this.dialog.open(N,o)}}return t.\u0275fac=function(n){return new(n||t)(e.Y36(l.uw))},t.\u0275cmp=e.Xpm({type:t,selectors:[["app-c-projects"]],decls:9,vars:2,consts:[["mat-mini-fab","","color","primary","matTooltip","Back",3,"routerLink"],[1,"example-spacer"],["style","margin-bottom: 5px;",3,"ngClass","click",4,"ngFor","ngForOf"],[2,"margin-bottom","5px",3,"ngClass","click"],[3,"innerHTML"],["mat-card-sm-image","",3,"src"],["inset",""],["mat-button",""]],template:function(n,o){1&n&&(e.TgZ(0,"mat-toolbar")(1,"span")(2,"button",0)(3,"mat-icon"),e._uU(4,"arrow_back"),e.qZA()(),e._uU(5," C Projects"),e.qZA(),e._UZ(6,"span",1),e.qZA(),e._UZ(7,"br"),e.YNc(8,Q,15,4,"mat-card",2)),2&n&&(e.xp6(2),e.Q6J("routerLink","/c-dashboard"),e.xp6(6),e.Q6J("ngForOf",o.questions))},directives:[m.Ye,g.lW,_.gM,h.rH,f.Hw,p.sg,c.a8,p.mk,U.oO,c.C1,c.n5,c.$j,c.vP,b.d,c.hq],styles:["mat-card[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{font-size:18px}.example-spacer[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{flex:1 1 auto}"]}),t})();var s=i(3075),L=i(6087),u=i(8279);let Z=(()=>{class t{}return t.genericError="Something went wrong.
